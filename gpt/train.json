It's a SaaS based company that gives users real estate analytics for homes all on the market all over the UK. Alacrity had bought the small startup & tasked me with leading the technical acquisition of the company. That means all technical assets were moved over to Alacrity's servers, and I had to make sure everything worked smoothly. Once that was done, I taught myself the codebase and started adding features to the app. I worked alongside a marketing manager, and another jr developper, and under the CTO & CEO. Weekly strategy meetings resulted in a conclusion that the full software should be rewritten. Over a three month period, we redesigned the webpage (in Laravel, HTML & CSS), recreated the database (MySQL, AWS RDS), worked with realtors to create a better algorithm for real estate analysis (python) and connected everythng using PHP."}

It was the first language I learned in university (about 5 years ago), and I've used it for a variety of projects in different situations ever since. Engineering physics courses require complex mathematical models so I have used a lot of python for class problem sets. This means a LOT of Numpy and Pandas use. All of the AI/ML projects I've done, from my Thesis to the QMIND projects have all been in python. Lots of project experience with packages like TensorFlow, OpenCV and PyTorch. I have done a lot of web scraping work for database aggregation both in projects and for work, so I am very familliar with Scrapy. Finally, my first internship required me to create a beginner python course for high school students and teach it myself. This solidified a strong fundamental knowledge of the language."}

A goup of my fellow engineering physics classmates got together and wanted to come up with an project that required as little physics as possible (we were far more interested in computaing by this point). We bonded over an issue that touched every engineer on campus - the incredibly long wait times for the engineering bar. We came up with the idea of using a point based machine learning model to determine the amount of people in line and from that, calculate the wait time. I chose to spearhead the app development using React Native, creating a user friendly application that would display wait time statistics for the bar with the possibility of expanding to other local bars. I also worked on the point based machine learning model, which ended up having a 90%+ accuracy rate. The best part of the project, though, was spending our Friday class at the bar in order to 'set up the materials' ;). "}

I hated biology and was really bad at chemistry so physics seemed to be the path to take. I did really like it for my first year but once I joined QMIND, an AI club on campus, I realized that I loved working in teams with engineers. I also found a strong interest in coding. I chose at the end of my second year to transfer into Engineering in order to get more experience with each of those things. I chose engineering physics because I wanted to graduate within 5 years. By the end of my degree, I was far more interested in my computing minor than any of my physics classes. My capstone and thesis were both based solely around programming with little to no relation to physics (sorry Queen's ENPH department). Although I'm very greatful for my experience with physics, I'm very excited to be moving into a career in software engineering."}

            {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is actually i pretty intuitive conecpt. When we think of many of the resons people make mistakes while driving, a lot of it comes down to not enough information about what is happening around them. Is this person going to merge? Is that person going to stop abruptly? What is going on behind that semi truck? All of these predicaments could be solved if we had a hollistic view of the space around us & information and knowledge of the decisions of other vehicles. This is what cooperative perception aims to solve. It allows cars to 'talk to' eachother, exchanging points of view and decisions to be made. This way, a car can know what is happening around it, even if it can't see it. This is especially useful for autonomous vehicles, as it allows them to make decisions based on the information of other vehicles, not just their own sensors. Cooperative perception is not only between cars though, infrastructure surrounding the area as well as satellite information can be used to create a more complete picture of the environment."}

I had to learn how to use the CRM software and how to use the analytics software. I had to learn how to use the marketing software and how to use the email software.
