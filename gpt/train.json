It's a SaaS based company that gives users real estate analytics for homes all on the market all over the UK. Alacrity had bought the small startup & tasked me with leading the technical acquisition of the company. That means all technical assets were moved over to Alacrity's servers, and I had to make sure everything worked smoothly. Once that was done, I taught myself the codebase and started adding features to the app. I worked alongside a marketing manager, and another jr developper, and under the CTO & CEO. Weekly strategy meetings resulted in a conclusion that the full software should be rewritten. Over a three month period, we redesigned the webpage (in Laravel, HTML & CSS), recreated the database (MySQL, AWS RDS), worked with realtors to create a better algorithm for real estate analysis (python) and connected everythng using PHP."}

It was the first language I learned in university (about 5 years ago), and I've used it for a variety of projects in different situations ever since. Engineering physics courses require complex mathematical models so I have used a lot of python for class problem sets. This means a LOT of Numpy and Pandas use. All of the AI/ML projects I've done, from my Thesis to the QMIND projects have all been in python. Lots of project experience with packages like TensorFlow, OpenCV and PyTorch. I have done a lot of web scraping work for database aggregation both in projects and for work, so I am very familliar with Scrapy. Finally, my first internship required me to create a beginner python course for high school students and teach it myself. This solidified a strong fundamental knowledge of the language."}

A goup of my fellow engineering physics classmates got together and wanted to come up with an project that required as little physics as possible (we were far more interested in computaing by this point). We bonded over an issue that touched every engineer on campus - the incredibly long wait times for the engineering bar. We came up with the idea of using a point based machine learning model to determine the amount of people in line and from that, calculate the wait time. I chose to spearhead the app development using React Native, creating a user friendly application that would display wait time statistics for the bar with the possibility of expanding to other local bars. I also worked on the point based machine learning model, which ended up having a 90%+ accuracy rate. The best part of the project, though, was spending our Friday class at the bar in order to 'set up the materials' ;). "}

I chose at the end of my second year to transfer into Engineering in order to get more experience with each of those things. I chose engineering physics because I wanted to graduate within 5 years. By the end of my degree, I was far more interested in my computing minor than any of my physics classes. My capstone and thesis were both based solely around programming with little to no relation to physics (sorry Queen's ENPH department).

When we think of many of the resons people make mistakes while driving, a lot of it comes down to not enough information about what is happening around them. Is this person going to merge? Is that person going to stop abruptly? What is going on behind that semi truck? All of these predicaments could be solved if we had a hollistic view of the space around us & information and knowledge of the decisions of other vehicles. This is what cooperative perception aims to solve. It allows cars to 'talk to' eachother, exchanging points of view and decisions to be made. This way, a car can know what is happening around it, even if it can't see it. This is especially useful for autonomous vehicles, as it allows them to make decisions based on the information of other vehicles, not just their own sensors. Cooperative perception is not only between cars though, infrastructure surrounding the area as well as satellite information can be used to create a more complete picture of the environment."}

Using AI in health tech has revolutionized the field and done things that would have never been possible. Education, transportation, and renewable energy are just a few of the fields currently being revolutionized by AI.

Even something as seemingly harmless as the technology used to create a fake drake song has the possibility to be used to create a hyper realistic video of politicialns, militants, or terrorists saying and doing things that never happened. I'll leave it to you to think of the reprocussions that could ensue. AI is a double edged sword, able to bring society into a new age to technological matruity, but also able to corrupt and destabalize the world as we know it. "}

It is very important, as any kind of employee, to take constructive criticism well. Because I have been had a job pretty consistenly since I was 14 years old, I have had to take a lot of criticism in my time from employers and customers alike. I have learned to deal with this very well. When I am criticized, usually constructively, I listen carefully to what the people say. I want to make sure that I am totally understanding what criticisms they are putting on me. Then, if I find something unfair or untrue, I will voice that respectfully. If I find something that I agree with, I will thank them for their input and make sure to take it into consideration in the future. I think that constructive criticism is a great way to learn and grow, and I am always open to it."}

I knew that this would be a problem for the company as more and more people are using their phones to access the internet. I took it upon myself to make the website responsive, and I did so in a way that would not affect the current design of the website. I did this by creating a new CSS file that would only be used when the website was being accessed on a mobile device. This way, the website would still look the same on a computer, but would be responsive on a phone. I was very proud of this solution, and the company was very happy with the result."}

            {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think that as we have seen in the past year with the emergence of large language models like chat-GPT, software engineering will become much more efficient. Paired programming with AI will allow for much faster development and bug fixing, leading to much more efficient workers. I believe that although there will be some automation. Many people are worried that AI will take over the jobs of software engineers, but I think that it will just make them more efficient. I think that software engineers will be able to do more in less time, and will be able to create more complex and interesting projects. I think that software engineering will become a much more important part of our society, and will be used to solve many of the problems that we are facing today. Climate change is a massive issue at the forefront of people's minds today. I hope the green-tech revolution continues and engineers are able to create and contribute to ideas that will help us save our planet."}
