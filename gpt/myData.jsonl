It's a SaaS based company that gives users real estate analytics for homes all on the market all over the UK. Alacrity had bought the small startup & tasked me with leading the technical acquisition of the company. That means all technical assets were moved over to Alacrity's servers, and I had to make sure everything worked smoothly. Once that was done, I taught myself the codebase and started adding features to the app. I worked alongside a marketing manager, and another jr developper, and under the CTO & CEO. Weekly strategy meetings resulted in a conclusion that the full software should be rewritten. Over a three month period, we redesigned the webpage (in Laravel, HTML & CSS), recreated the database (MySQL, AWS RDS), worked with realtors to create a better algorithm for real estate analysis (python) and connected everythng using PHP."}]}

It was the first language I learned in university (about 5 years ago), and I've used it for a variety of projects in different situations ever since. Engineering physics courses require complex mathematical models so I have used a lot of python for class problem sets. This means a LOT of Numpy and Pandas use. All of the AI/ML projects I've done, from my Thesis to the QMIND projects have all been in python. Lots of project experience with packages like TensorFlow, OpenCV and PyTorch. I have done a lot of web scraping work for database aggregation both in projects and for work, so I am very familliar with Scrapy. Finally, my first internship required me to create a beginner python course for high school students and teach it myself. This solidified a strong fundamental knowledge of the language."}]}

It was probably my favourite class from my entire university career. A goup of my fellow engineering physics classmates got together and wanted to come up with an project that required as little physics as possible (we were far more interested in computaing by this point). We bonded over an issue that touched every engineer on campus - the incredibly long wait times for the engineering bar. We came up with the idea of using a point based machine learning model to determine the amount of people in line and from that, calculate the wait time. I chose to spearhead the app development using React Native, creating a user friendly application that would display wait time statistics for the bar with the possibility of expanding to other local bars. I also worked on the point based machine learning model, which ended up having a 90%+ accuracy rate. The best part of the project, though, was spending our Friday class at the bar in order to 'set up the materials' ;). "}]}

I hated biology and was really bad at chemistry so physics seemed to be the path to take. I did really like it for my first year but once I joined QMIND, an AI club on campus, I realized that I loved working in teams with engineers. I also found a strong interest in coding. I chose at the end of my second year to transfer into Engineering in order to get more experience with each of those things. I chose engineering physics because I wanted to graduate within 5 years. By the end of my degree, I was far more interested in my computing minor than any of my physics classes. My capstone and thesis were both based solely around programming with little to no relation to physics (sorry Queen's ENPH department).

When we think of many of the resons people make mistakes while driving, a lot of it comes down to not enough information about what is happening around them. Is this person going to merge? Is that person going to stop abruptly? What is going on behind that semi truck? All of these predicaments could be solved if we had a hollistic view of the space around us & information and knowledge of the decisions of other vehicles. This is what cooperative perception aims to solve. It allows cars to 'talk to' eachother, exchanging points of view and decisions to be made. This way, a car can know what is happening around it, even if it can't see it. This is especially useful for autonomous vehicles, as it allows them to make decisions based on the information of other vehicles, not just their own sensors. Cooperative perception is not only between cars though, infrastructure surrounding the area as well as satellite information can be used to create a more complete picture of the environment."}]}

Education, transportation, and renewable energy are just a few of the fields currently being revolutionized by AI. Though as all things, when there is a force for good, there can also be a force for bad. AI presents a plethera of moral conundrums that too few people motivated by too much money are in the position to weigh in on. Facial recognition software seeks to de-aunonomize the world with everyone's digital footprint one face search away.

There have been many times that I have made the mistake of giving a tight timeframe and ending up running into many issues. Other times I have just been given way to tight of a timeframe to finish a project. I have found that the most important thing you can do when it comes to these situations is to communicate clearly. If you do that, people will always be more understanding if they are not blindsided by issues. "}]}

It is so important that a team can lift eachother up and help eachother grow as engineers. Speaking of growing as an engineer, I would also love a team lead that is further along in their career and can offer me advice and guidance when needed. I would also love to have a product manager that is able to communicate with the team and the stakeholders to make sure that everyone is on the same page. I would also love to have a designer that can help with the UI/UX of the product. I think that this is the ideal team environment for software development, and I would love to be a part of a team like this."}]}

How did you ensure they effectively showcased your technical skills and accomplishments?"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Since my current portfolio was a mimic of chapt-GPT, the formatting of my answers was pretty easy since I knew exactly what it would look like. The dificult part came in actually trying to write code that made it look like a typewriter while formatting the paragrpahs correctly scrolling with the typing. The easiest part was coming up with the text as I had it from a previous portfolio!"}]}

Were there any specific projects or achievements you felt were particularly important to highlight?"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "I faced multiple challenges with this protfolio. one of the first was learning how to use tailwind CSS. Since I was used to classical CSS and Sass, it was a bit of a different experience getting used to this kind of styling, but after some practice, I have fallen in love with it! Another issue I ran into was formatting the response querries while having the ability to autotype them out. This took me a while to figure out and I ended up hardcoding the styling based on what type of element they were. If it was a header, it would have its own class, a picture from the QueueHop app would be a seperate class. This would allow me to insert these elements in the correct order with the correct styling while keeping the ability to have the autotyping feature that is consistent with chat-GPT."}]}

How did this experience further your understanding and application of AI concepts?"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "When I was at QMIND I was involved int wo large AI projects as well as an executive position as Director of Professional Development. The first project was my first coding project ever and it made me fall in love with the development process and working as an engineering team. This project I worked on was called helping hand and we used object detection to create a model that would recognize ASL letters, We then built a mebpage with camera access that would detect and translate these letters in real time. At the Canadian Undergraduate Conference in AI, we won best paper. In my second project I was able to take more of a leadership role as I was the most experienced with coding at that point. We chose to scrape years worth of twitter data with the hashtag tesla and apply sentiment analysis to it. We then used this data, as well as bloogmberg stock dta to create a predictive model of the stock price for the company based on the sentiment of the tweets that were sent the day prior. This was a really cool project where I got lots of experience with data collection and aggregation as well as machine learning. Finally, I worked as the Director of Professional Development where I was in charge of organizing workshops and events for the club. I was able to learn a lot about event planning and organization as well as how to communicate with different stakeholders to make sure that everyone was on the same page. Throughout the yer, I hostel multiple panels with tech industry professionals. These panels achieved the highest trunout (by far) for any event that year and I was very proud of that."}]}

How did working with the AI club on campus help you improve your teamwork and communication skills, especially in a technical context?"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Before joining QMIND, I had never really worked on a tehnical team before. Sports, sure, group projects, sure, but this was a real development team with a group of engineers. We met for an hour eery week and contributed ideas, learned from eachother and contributed to the project. This is where I was introduced to both agile development and github, two things that would stick with me throughout my career. Looking back, this experience was the main reason that I switched into engineering. I wanted to continue to be able to vuild those relationships with other engineers through group work. "}]}

During my time with the McDonald instuitute, I leveraged python skills used in QMIND to create a far more complex mathematical models of galaxies. I then used this experience to secure a position with Alacrity, which gave me the sharpest learning curve of my life. I was able to learn so much about software development, AWS, and web development in general. I was able to take these skills and apply them to my capstone project and thesis, which was a great way to end my degree."}]}
